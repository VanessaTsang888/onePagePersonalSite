# One Page Personal Site

My one page responsive personal website now published using [GitHub Pages](https://vanessatsang888.github.io/onePagePersonalSite)

## About

This is one of my personal projects that I am keeping maintained around my full time as Frontend UI Engineer as one of my personal objectives is to keep on top of my HTML5 and CSS2/3 skills.
For this project I have written some intermediate **HTML5** code and some intermediate **CSS2/3** code to develop this one page responsive website.

Next Up:

The plan is to use Boostrap to make the CSS code more effient and to make this website fully responsive. Then I will use JavaScript ES6 to add some behaviour to the website including form some validation etc.

### The Purpose

This one page website is one of my personal projects that I have been working on around my day job on various government projects. Please note that I have NOT published any of my commercial government projects (defence and national security) within my software enginnering work as they are of sensitive nature. However, in the near future, I will be able to include a link to a commercial project (within my responsive portfolio website) that I've worked on as this is a public facing and dynamic portal application that allows users to apply for a government grant online efficiently, reducing most of the paperwork for the customer and better control of the 'climate change issue' that the whole world is currently facing.

### CSS2/3 Concepts Covered In This Website

The CSS2/3 concepts that I have covered in developing this web app are:

1. CSS Display Property,
2. CSS Static and Relative,
3. Absolute Positioning,
4. Typography,
5. CSS Sizing,
6. and CSS Float & Clear (image next to some text).

#### How To Run This Web App Locally

To run this CV website locally:

1. Download the zipped file within my [GitHub repo](https://vanessatsang888.github.io/onePagePersonalSite)
2. Open the **index.html** (homepage) file in your Google Chrome browser. This will launch the one page website locally.
3. Now you may scroll up and down the page.
4. You may also take a good look at the code base specifically how the code in the **style.css** is written.
5. Test the site in the UI and changing some of the code if this helps you understand how the CSS code is written.
